# **Project Description: FAQ Chatbot for Travel and Accommodation with Fine-Tuning of Falcon 7B**  

This project involves the development a high-end chatbot that can reply to any sort of frequently asked question related to traveling and its accommodation. Here, the proposed model was fine-tuned from the pre-trained Falcon 7B. It was done with a special dataset comprising pairs of questions and answers, prepared in this domain.

### Objective  
The big goal is to help the users have a smooth, speedy, and correct support experience, similar to how it is now with Booking or Airbnb. This bot would understand any kind of question a user could have with regard to traveling and staying and then create an appropriate answer for that in order for the user to self-serve.

### Features  
- **Contextual Responses:** The model has been fine-tuned to deliver highly relevant answers to users' questions.  
- **Specialized Domain Knowledge:** Focused on topics such as reservations, cancellation policies, amenities, accommodation locations, and other frequently asked questions in the travel and hospitality sector.  
- **Advanced Interactivity:** Offers a smooth and adaptable user experience, enabling interactions in natural language.  

---

### Technologies Used  
- **Base Model:** Falcon 7B is a state-of-the-art open-source LLM.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Carried out on a customized dataset in order to achieve expertise in the travel and accommodation domain.
- **Inference Pipeline:** The architecture of this pipeline will ensure speed with accuracy for user query responses.

### Expected Impact  
The chatbot reduces response time for frequent queries, improves customer experience, and lightens the load for human support teams working in travel and accommodation companies.  

This project represents one of the applied uses of artificial intelligence, combining advanced machine learning with a solution fitted into real-world market needs.

### Workflow

1. **Model and Tokenizer Setup**: First, the pre-trained Falcon 7B model and its tokenizer are downloaded from the Hugging Face Model Hub. These would form the base for the chatbot.

2. **Quantization Setup**: Quantization is done to improve model performance with less resource usage. With the BitsAndBytes configuration, memory usage is efficiently achieved by enabling quantization at 4-bit while having faster inferences without losing accuracy.

3. **Parameter Freezing and Head Creation**: All pre-trained model parameters are frozen to put the focus of the training process on it. A new classification head is added on top to allow the model to specialize in generating domain-specific responses without altering its foundational knowledge.

4. **Fine-Tuning with LoRA**: Fine-tuning is done using LoRA, a method for adapting large language models with very low computational overhead. This ensures that the model remains highly adaptable to the travel and accommodation domain while keeping resource usage at efficient levels.

5. **Trainer Configuration**: Training is managed by a configuration that includes, but is not limited to, learning rate, batch size, and evaluation strategy. These are carefully chosen by hand to strike a balance between the speed of training and the model performance.

6. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing will involve tokenization of input questions and their respective answers. This ensures that data is in the right format for training; thus, the model learns effectively from the provided dataset.

7. **Model Training**: During training, the model is fine-tuned on the preprocessed data to enable the model to learn relationships of questions/answers in the travel and accommodation domain, thereby improving its ability in generating relevant responses.

8. **Model Evaluation**: BLEU - Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, calculates the model performance by looking for similarities between the model responses and the reference answers, hence giving an objective judgment of the precision and relevance of the chatbot's responses.

9. **Inference**:  The model, being fine-tuned, is able to make the chatbot predict according to user inputs. Given a question, the model processes the input and generates a response aligned with the patterns learned during training. This functionality enables the chatbot to address FAQs in an effective manner and provide accurate answers regarding the context of the question being asked.

### Conclusion
This documentation describes the process of fine-tuning a robust chatbot on travel and accommodation. It will use advanced techniques, such as quantization and LoRA, to strike a balance between efficiency and good performance. Using the BLEU metric for evaluation makes it very reliable; hence, this chatbot is a goldmine in answering customer inquiries automatically and effectively.
